Inline have the highest specificity
    <p style=“color: white;”> 
    p{color: blue} 

IDs are next, represented by #
    #div

Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes
    Classes, and the attributes inside the selectors, come next with what is called the pseudo-classes that you will soon learn more about. 

    For example:
    .my-class 
    p[“attribute”]
    div:hover

Calculating scores
How to determine the score of a few selectors. 
    #hello {} will be 0100
    div {} will be 0001 and
    div p.foo {} will be 0012

    p  => 1 element =>  0 0 0 1 => Score: 1
    div p => 2 elements => 0 0 0 2 => Score: 2
    div p.foo {} => 2 elements and 1 class selector => 0 0 1 2 => Score: 12

    p#bar => 1 element & 1 ID =>  0 1 0 1 => Score: 101
    p.foo => 1 element & 1 class => 0 0 1 1 => Score: 11
    p.p.foo => 1 element & 2 class =>  0 0 2 1 => Score: 21


-----------
Combination selectors
(>) child selector
    selects all elements that are the children of a specified element
    div > p {}

(~) general sibling selector
    selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
    div ~ p {}

(+) adjacent sibling selector
    select an element that is directly after another specific element.
    must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
    div + p {}

( ) descendant selector
    matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element
    div p {}

        line-height: 1;
    }

::selection

        padding-left: 3px;
        padding-right: 5px;
        border-radius: 10%;

    #tips::after{
        background:darkkhaki;
        color:darkslategray;
